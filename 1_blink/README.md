# Blink

Here we will read the state of a button with the Arduino and mirror this state by lighting an LED.

# Hardware setup


# Code

```c++


void setup() {
}

void loop() {
}
```

# Now What?
Build the curcuit, upload the code, push the button.

Does the LED light up? - Is it the proper way around?

Try "inverting the logic", and making the LED turn **OFF** when you push the button.
