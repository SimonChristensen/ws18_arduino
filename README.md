# AUHack Arduino workshop
This workshop will introduce you to basic Arduino. We will connect an LED (indicator), Force sensor (analog sensor), and a servo (analog actuator). We will of course also show you how to program the Arduino to work with these sensors and how they can work together. 

The workshop is a hands-on walkthrough of some of the examples from the arduino website, and some examples that we have rolled ourselves.

**You will be working in pairs.**
